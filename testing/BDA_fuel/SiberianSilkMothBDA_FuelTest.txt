>> NOTE: LOTS OF GOOD RESEARCH ON SPECIES-LEVEL ON THE SPECIES LEVEL TO REFINE WHAT IS BELOW, BUT LESS INFORMATION ON AGE-SPECIFIC PREFERENCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY PATTERNS.
>> HostPreference ages are the minimum age when species will function as a host at different levels of preference.
>> We assume the "Appropriateness Index" will scale with Site Resource Dominance Probability associated with the species, rescaled between the best host (Larch = 1) to the worst host (Scot's Pine = 0.1)

>> See: Kirichenko NI and Baranchikov YN. 2007. Appropriateness of needles of different conifer species for the feeding and growth of larvae from two populations of the Siberian moth. Russ J Ecol 38: 198â€“203.

>> We assume younger age classes offer less foliage, and therefore decrease accordingly (e.g., Minor & 2nd Host are 0.25 and 0.5 of the Primary age class for the species.  
>> Susceptibility age is the minimum age when species will be killed by outbreak of the severity class

>> Expert Opinion (Kharuk) is once defolation occurs, all age classes are affected.  So vulnerability is standardized so all age classes are equally susceptible. 

>> Exception is the additional synergistic effect of boring insects - there is a size threshold for fir (dbh = 16cm) vulnerable to boring insects.  
>> primary impacts to fir (both beetles) with some impacts to spruce by the native wood borer.

>> Larch requires 2 years severe defoliation to kill. 
 
>> Baseline susceptibility = 0.7.  Larch susceptibility is half that (0.35) reflecting above difference in its ability to survive a single year of defoliation.
>> Assumed age at which spruce or fir reach 16cm DBH is 40 years.
>> Above that age threshold, susceptibility of fir increases to 1.0 to reflect beetle-enhanced mortality by two species.  Spruce increases to 0.85 to reflect beetle-enhanced mortality from one species.
>> Scots pine assumed to have less susceptibilty since survival of larvae is diminished

>> primary critique from Anatoly is that the duration of the outbreak matters a great deal - specifically for larch.  if the outbreak is interrupted after only a year of extensive larch damage, all larch survive.
>> We may want to modify the code to define duration as part of spread.
